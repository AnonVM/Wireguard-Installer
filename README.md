# WireGuard VPN Installer: Easy Setup for Linux Servers

**Easily install and configure a [WireGuard VPN](https://www.wireguard.com/) on your Linux server with this simple bash script.** 

WireGuard is a high-performance, secure, and lightweight VPN protocol that can be set up quickly and used in various network scenarios. This script simplifies the installation process, allowing you to create a point-to-point VPN where all client traffic is routed through an encrypted tunnel to the server. The server then applies NAT, making it appear as if the client is browsing the web using the server's IP address.

### Key Features:
- **Supports IPv4 and IPv6**: Ensuring compatibility with modern networks.
- **Easy Client Management**: Add or remove clients by simply rerunning the script.
- **Systemd Integration**: Automatically create a systemd service for efficient management.

If WireGuard doesnâ€™t meet your needs, consider our [OpenVPN installer](https://github.com/AnonVM/OpenVPN-Installer).

- AlmaLinux 8 or higher
- Arch Linux
- CentOS Stream 8 or higher
